Data update tools
=================

update-tzdata.py
  - downloads tzdata updates and regenerates the ICU and
    libcore/bionic timezone data files.
    There are sometimes code and metadata changes associated
    with tzdata updates that should be applied to ICU at the same time.
    e.g. see http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/search?q=2015d

    ICU and CTS tests for bionic / libcore should be run before
    and after.
